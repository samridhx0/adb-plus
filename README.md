Streamline everyday Android workflows in a single, clean interface: manage apps, run shell commands, launch screen mirroring (scrcpy), and generate quick forensic-style snapshots for triage and documentation.

> Experimental project — use with caution. Always ensure you have permission to interact with any device, and verify outputs independently before relying on them.
